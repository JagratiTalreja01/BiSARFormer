# BiSARFormerGAN: Dual-Band SAR-to-Optical Translation via Transformer-Enhanced GAN
BiSARFormer is a deep learning framework for translating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery into perceptually realistic optical imagery using dual polarization inputs (VV &amp; VH) via local cross-attention fusion, and a Transformer-based generator within a GAN setup to capture complementary scattering patterns. 


The code is built on [MT_GAN (PyTorch)](https://github.com/NUAA-RS/MT_GAN) and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.6 environment (Python 3.10.13, PyTorch >= 1.1.0) with NVIDIA RTX A4000 with 16GB RAM.

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of BiSARFormerGAN, a dual-band SAR-to-Optical translation framework designed for flood assessment. The architecture introduces dual-stem processing for Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarizations, followed by Local Cross-Attention Fusion (LCAF) to exploit their complementary scattering properties. To balance local spatial detail and global contextual modeling, the network integrates CNN backbones with Transformer modules inside a GAN framework, enhanced by SE-gated skip connections.

Trained on the DeepFlood dataset, BiSARFormerGAN generates optical-like imagery that preserves fine-grained structures, improves perceptual quality, and supports reliable flood mapping and disaster response.

Key Highlights:

Dual-Polarization Processing: Independent stems for SAR VV and VH bands, extracting complementary scattering features.

Local Cross-Attention Fusion (LCAF): Adaptive fusion mechanism that leverages interactions between VV and VH polarizations for richer representation.

Hybrid GANâ€“Transformer Framework: Combines the perceptual realism of GANs with the global contextual modeling power of Transformers.

SE-Gated Skip Connections: Noise-aware skip links that selectively pass useful features while suppressing SAR-induced artifacts.

Efficient and Stable Training: Incorporates Residual Swin Transformer Blocks and multi-loss optimization (L1, SSIM, perceptual, adversarial) for balanced realism and accuracy.

Superior Performance: Outperforms state-of-the-art SAR-to-Optical translation models on the DeepFlood dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while producing interpretable optical-like outputs for real flood events.

BiSARFormerGAN bridges SAR and optical modalities, improving the usability of SAR imagery for flood mapping, disaster response, and geospatial analysis.

## Train
### Prepare training data 

1. Download DEEPFLOOD Dataset, which includes co-registered Sentinel-1 SAR (VV, VH) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery, along with UAV references and auxiliary layers (NDWI, slope, DTM, flood masks). from [DEEPFLOOD dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DEEPFLOOD_DATASET_High-Resolution_Dataset_for_Accurate_Flood_Mappingand_Segmentation/28328339).

2. Use SAR_VH, SAR_VV  for Dual-Polarization input and UAV tiles for Target Optical

3. Create train, test and validation sets 70%, 15% & 15%

4. Specify '--dir_data' based on the image's path.
