# BiSARFormer
BiSARFormer is a deep learning framework for translating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery into perceptually realistic optical imagery using dual polarization inputs (VV &amp; VH) via local cross-attention fusion, and a Transformer-based generator within a GAN setup to capture complementary scattering patterns.
